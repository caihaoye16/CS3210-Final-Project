Done:
- Write some user programs to test the special cases for which we wrote checks in page_map and page_unmap:
  (1) Mapping a page that was paged out.
  (2) Mapping *over* a page that was paged out. <Punted>
  (3) Unmapping a page that was paged out
- Debug page_map and page_unmap
Todo:
- Merge in add_page_lib --> finalized base paging system (hopefully)
- Think about LRU

Page age:
- Develop reverse map (linked list) from PageInfo structs to ptes
- Implement kernel-side hook every N clock ticks to iterate through pages and look for PTE_A bits, update PageInfo structs to indicate this
- Try implementing a couple of different ways to maintain age
