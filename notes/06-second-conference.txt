- use existing page table to save indices of paged out pages, save space ??
- Linux: map from page to environments that use it
- if we allow one env to page out another's pages: fairness policy needed (least used page across system, or memory hogging env)
- in theory, concurrency isn't an issue
- (microkernel style?) make page server be in charge of unmapping
- write benchmarks, think/test good scheme
- lots of research done on this in the 60s

Good start on getting the mechanism for paging to work. To get an A or B, you should work out on some reasonable policy for page replacement and implement it. Make sure it handles running several applications well.
